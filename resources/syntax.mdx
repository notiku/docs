## Formatting a duration

When a command requires a `duration` parameter, you format it as a number followed by a unit. The unit can be one of the following:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.

For example, `1h` represents one hour, and `1d` represents one day. You can also combine units, for example, `3d1h` represents three days and one hour.

## Flags

When a command supports flags, you can use them to modify the command's behavior. Flags are mostly optional and can be used to specify additional options.

For example, if a command supports a `--audio` flag, you can use it like this:

```bash
-download https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ --audio
```

Some flags can be used with a value, like `--quality`:

```bash
-download https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ --quality 1080
```

You can also chain flags together, like this:

```bash
-download https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ --audio --quality 1080
```
