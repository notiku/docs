If Echo returns an unexpected result when using a flag, check that you're using the correct `--` (two hyphens) and not a long dash `—`. On iOS, typing two dashes often gets auto-replaced with a long dash, which breaks command-line flags.

To fix this, disable **Smart Punctuation** on your iOS device: go to **Settings** → **General** → **Keyboard**, then turn off **Smart Punctuation**.
